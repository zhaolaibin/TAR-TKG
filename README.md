Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for your attention to our work and for your valuable suggestions. Regarding the request to share the source code, we fully understand the importance of code availability for ensuring the reproducibility of academic research. However, as the study is still ongoing, some parts of the data processing and algorithm development are not yet finalized or are being used in follow-up projects that have not been made public. Therefore, we are currently unable to share the complete source code.

We are committed to making the relevant code available on a public platform once the research is completed and officially released, in order to promote academic exchange and collaboration. In the meantime, if you are interested in specific implementation details, we would be happy to provide additional technical descriptions or pseudocode upon request.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,  
ZhaoLaibin
